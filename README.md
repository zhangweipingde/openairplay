# openairplay

We use: https://github.com/jamesdlow/open-airplay with a few optimizations and fixes for airplaying to AppleTVs from non-apple devices.

I've optimized it a little for a higher framerate with desktop capturing, and I've fixed a few common error handling problems that caused it to fail and crash.

# Usage
